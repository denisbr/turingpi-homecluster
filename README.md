# TuringPi Home Cluster v0.01

TL;DR:

* Talos Linux 1.9.3
* TuringPi RK1 nodes x3 (8GB RAM)
* Talhelper (https://budimanjojo.github.io/talhelper)
* sops / age / 1password

## What is this

A very basic cluster init to learn as much as possible about Talos and the TuringPi API/CLI.
Chose to not go directly to IaC for this one to learn more and not abstract away everything right off the bat.
