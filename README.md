# TuringPi Home Cluster v0.01

TL;DR:

* Talos Linux 1.9.3
* TuringPi RK1 nodes x3 (8GB RAM)
* [Talhelper|https://budimanjojo.github.io/talhelper]
* [sops|https://github.com/getsops/sops] with [age|https://github.com/filoSottile/age]
* 1Password with the op CLI

## What is this

A very basic cluster init to learn as much as possible about Talos and the
TuringPi API/CLI.
Chose to not go directly to IaC for this one to learn more and not abstract
away everything right off the bat.

Uses SOPS
